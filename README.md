### Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Informática, 4º Ano 2015/216

Assignment where the objective was to create a centralized sports betting system.
The assignment was divided into four parts:

  1 - Create the initial base of the application, knowing that further changes would occur.
  
  2 - The concept of a bookie is introduced: He's the one responsbile for creating the events and changing its odds. 
  They can also follow other events.
  
  3 - Bookies/Punters should be notified when odds from an event they're following change or when the event itself ends. 
  Those features should be implemented with the Observer Design Pattern.
  
  4 -  The punter can search his bet history using filters. The filters must allow conjugation of logical expressions and have to be created during runtime.
      Implemented with the Criteria Design Pattern.



The project was written in C#.
